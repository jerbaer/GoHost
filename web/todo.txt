2. Modify user object to accommodate isAdmin
3. Modify the inbox and notification to accommodate for report notifications
    a. Modify the notifications js to accommodate if status is 3 (Meaning it's a report)
    b. Modify the notifications js to check if the user is an admin right away
4. Create on click functions where the admin either approves the report (deleting the event and the notification)
or rejects the report (simply deleting the notification)
